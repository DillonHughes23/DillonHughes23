# Hello, I'm Dillon Hughes

Welcome to my GitHub profile! As a passionate individual with a keen interest in Data Science and Front-End Software Engineering, I've compiled a variety of projects that 
reflect my skills and dedication in these areas.

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from Texas State University, where I completed my studies in Computer Science in December of 2023. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong 
foundation in data science and software engineering, and I've honed my skills through various high-level computer science courses. My project portfolio here includes work 
in machine learning, recommender systems, and software engineering, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges in these fields.

## My Projects

In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of projects:

- **Machine Learning Projects**: Implementing advanced ML algorithms to solve real-world problems.
- **Recommender Systems**: Developing systems that provide personalized recommendations to users.
- **Software Engineering Projects**: Crafting efficient and user-friendly software solutions.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in programming, data analysis, and system design.

## What I'm Looking For

I am primarily seeking opportunities in Data Science, as I am deeply passionate about extracting meaningful insights from data and using them to drive decisions. However, 
I also have a strong interest in Software Engineering roles, especially those that allow me to contribute to front-end development. I am excited about roles that challenge 
me and allow me to grow while making a meaningful impact.
